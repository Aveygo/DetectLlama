Inspired by DetectGPT, I used Meta's llama to detect texts written by large language models.
This is more of an experiment of an idea than a fleshed out project. By using samples from ChatGPT and
r/writing prompts, there is (kinda?) a difference between probabilities, but more samples will be needed
to confirm it's effectiveness over the default GPT-2.
